## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS

### What I learned

Honestly this wasn't much of a learning curve for me, I did ge to finally implement centering a div, in my previous projects I tried to implement centering a div and failed miserably but I am starting to learn how to do it and all I needed to do was add height to the page.

### Continued development

I do wanna continue developing a better understanding of SCSS but this project didn't need much.
